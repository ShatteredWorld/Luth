// Per-frame editor snapshot: the frame boundary between gather (worker fibers) and
// draw (main thread). Mirrors the engine's RenderSnapshot pattern at smaller scale:
// gather workers fill per-panel fragments into each panel's own LinearAllocator,
// then Editor::Render assembles the read-only EditorSnapshot view on main and hands
// it to OnDraw. ImGui calls happen exclusively in OnDraw against the frozen view.
//
// Storage strategy is panel-local rather than a shared TaggedPageAllocator tag:
// the editor is single-frame (gather + draw run inside one App::Run iteration on
// the same thread sequence), not pipelined like Game/Render. TaggedPageAllocator's
// FreeTag would leak pages held in JobContext.CpuCache for fibers that don't run
// gather every frame. See history/v2.x/editor-foundation.md for the full rationale.
